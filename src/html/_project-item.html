          Lucidica is an IT company helping UK small and medium-sized businesses
          with technical challenges, innovations, and data protection. We
          redesigned their website to improve online presence, clarify services,
          and ensure a modern look.

        <p class="project-item__description">
          Before designing the new website, we conducted a detailed competitor
          analysis and gathered user feedback. The main issues of the previous
          design included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Complicated navigation – users struggled to find the services they
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            - No mobile responsiveness – the site did not function properly on
            smartphones.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Outdated UI – the visual style no longer met modern standards.

          Wireframes & Prototyping
        </h3>
        <p class="project-item__description">
          Before moving to the final design, we created wireframes to structure
          the layout and define key user flows. This step ensured an intuitive
          and efficient user experience by focusing on functionality before
          aesthetics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Low-Fidelity Wireframes – Early sketches to map out the structure
            and user interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            - High-Fidelity Wireframes – Detailed layouts incorporating key UI
            elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Interactive Prototypes – Clickable mockups to test usability and
            gather feedback before development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="project-item__description">
          By refining the design through wireframing and prototyping, we
          minimized revisions and ensured a seamless transition from concept to
          a fully functional product.

        <p class="project-item__description">
          To ensure consistency and scalability, I developed a comprehensive UI
          Kit that serves as the foundation for the entire design system. It
          includes essential components, typography, colors, buttons, icons, and
          form elements, ensuring a cohesive visual language across all pages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Typography & Color Palette – Defines the brand’s tone and
            accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Buttons & Forms – Designed for usability and responsiveness.
          </li>
          <li>- Icons & Components – Ensuring clarity and consistency.</li>
          <li>
            - Spacing & Grid System – Optimized for a seamless user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="project-item__description">
          The UI Kit streamlines the design process, improves collaboration, and
          maintains a unified aesthetic throughout the project.
